# Software

This section describes some of the software that we'll want to install on our sever.

## Caddy

Caddy is the web server we'll use to accept web requests, direct traffic to our projects,
serve static files, and generate TLS certificates.

Instructions for installing it are [here](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install#debian-ubuntu-raspbian).


## Docker

We'll use Docker to deploy projects.

Instructions for installing it are [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

## Extras

You'll probably want some CLI tools to help you work on the server as well. Here
are some of my favourites:

- [bat](https://crates.io/crates/bat)
- [ctop](https://github.com/bcicen/ctop)
- [Neo Vim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Python launcher for Unix](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher)
- [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu)
- [Magic Wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole)
